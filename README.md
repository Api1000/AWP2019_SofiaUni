The functionalities that need to be implemented are:
 - user registration,
 - view/edit user profile from each user,
 - only a registered user can place orders,
 - simulation of a "basket" where a user adds things until he/she completes an order,
 - a confirmation email should be sent when the order is completed,
 - the administrator of the application has a different interface,
 - the admin user can view statistics and information about the users (except from their password, which he/she can only reset to smth),
 - from the admin menu an upload functionality should exist from where an excel file is uploaded regarding new items in the Db,
 - view/edit information regarding the products - e.g. price, quantity, etc,
 - view and export statistics regarding the products - e.g. per product/category, weekly/daily/monthly/etc, most/least sold products etc.
