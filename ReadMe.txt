It will be the building of an eCommerce site. The products that will be displayed are not important - for example, you can use the tables with the products that we used in class for our examples. The important thing is to implement the required functionalities using the things we saw in our lectures - HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and javascript (which we 'll see in our next lectures).

The functionalities that need to be implemented are:
 - user registration,
 - view/edit user profile from each user,
 - only a registered user can place orders,
 - simulation of a "basket" where a user adds things until he/she completes an order,
 - a confirmation email should be sent when the order is completed,
 - the administrator of the application has a different interface,
 - the admin user can view statistics and information about the users (except from their password, which he/she can only reset to smth),
 - from the admin menu an upload functionality should exist from where an excel file is uploaded regarding new items in the Db,
 - view/edit information regarding the products - e.g. price, quantity, etc,
 - view and export statistics regarding the products - e.g. per product/category, weekly/daily/monthly/etc, most/least sold products etc.

These are typical functionalities that are provided in these type of sites. In our next class we can discuss if you want to replace anything with something else.

Our next lecture will be on the 13-th of May (6-th is a national holiday and there will be no lectures).
